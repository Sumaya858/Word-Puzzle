#### How the game works

 There is a start button to start the game,the player click it first and then play. There is a restart button to reatart the game after finishing the round. Music button too if the player want to listen to it. 

#### Parts whicÿß need to be developed
 The restart button need to be changed from reload the page to restart the game it self with a shuffle. Music option too add a mute and pause function to it.

#### Difficulties 
1. The if conditionals: I should put a condition inside a codition, so when I did it, it doesn't work. Then I change the words inside the block and replace it with the block number and still not working, then the block number into words. 
2. The pause function for the music and still it's not working.
3. a congrats alert it shown in a specific block when it's clicked.

### The code of the blocks

`var blockSeventeen = false;
var blockTwentyFour = false;

$(".block-17").click(function() {
  if (!blockTwentyFour) {
    $(this).css("background-color", "grey");
    blockSeventeen = true
    gameStatus= true 

    if (blockSeventeen && blockTwentyFour) {
      alert('Correct')
      gameStatus= true 
      
    }

  }
})
$(".block-24").click(function() {
  if (blockSeventeen && !blockTwentyFour ) {
    $(this).css("background-color", "grey")
    blockTwentyFour = true
    gameStatus= true 

    if (blockSeventeen && blockTwentyFour) {
      count = count + 1
        alert('Correct      your score: '+count)
      gameStatus= true 
      
     
    }
`
